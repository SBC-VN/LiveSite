            My life's work is to teach people, particularly children, that good dental hygine is of paramount importance.
            Besides the fact that a mouth full of funky green snaggle teeth doesn't look atractive, recent studies have found
            that gingivitius is at least linked to, and may cause, Alzhimers desease.   So, neglect your teeth and you will eventually
            be forced to neglect everything you know and are.
